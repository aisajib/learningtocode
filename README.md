# My Coding Journey from (sort of) zero!
Hey folks!

I recently started learning to code and created this repo to start hosting everything I'm learning. The `tinyprojects` folder will host stuff that are really insignificant stuff. As I learn to do things, the objective is to create simple websites and use JavaScript to turn them into simple programs. 

I write about my learning journey on https://codingjourney.blog. Feel free to drop by and subscribe via email for updates! My hope? You'll see my thinking process and solution and help me improve!

## Tiny Projects

This section shows the tiny projects. I mostly learned doing these things in console from various courses. I'm taking a step further and integrating them into simple websites. 

### Love Calculator 5000!
A throwback to the 90s websites! This awesome, totally-legit, fortune-telling website will take your and your crush's name and give you the percentage of love you both share!

### Fibonacci Sequence Generator
Just tell me how many numbers from the Fibonacci Sequence you need, and my futuristic website will build and output the sequence for you.
